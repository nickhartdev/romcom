## Project Timeline and Resources ##

This project was done completely remotely via video calls over a 6 day period. We used gitHub projects to track our progress alongside git version control and ultimately completed the specifications through iteration 4.   

## Successes ##

- **Dom Manipulation**: We developed a better understanding of query selectors, event listeners, and using functions to make the site more interactive.

- **Remote Collaboration**: This project was an excellent opportunity to gain experience in remote teamwork and planning.

- **Git Workflow**: We gained a better understanding of best practices using git workflow by applying our working knowledge to a larger project.
